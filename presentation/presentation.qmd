# Use `.Rproj` {.allowframebreaks}

Please use an `.Rproj` for every project you do. Save all your related files in this project. I will only accept submissions that are `.Rproj`.

# Use `here` {.allowframebreaks}

[![Illustration by Allison Horst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/here.png){width="300"}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/here.png)

When referring to *any* file -- data, script, report -- please always use the package `here`. You start in your `.Rproj` and then refer to paths like so:

```         
library(here)
data <- here("data/my_data.csv") |> read.csv()
```

# Use `renv` {.allowframebreaks}

[![](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/logo.svg){width="100"}]()

When you want to share your project, the other person needs to download all the needed libraries. `renv` helps with that.

To use:

```         
renv::activate()
renv::snapshot()
```

To recover the libraries:

```         
renv::hydrate()
```

# Use version control with github {.allowframebreaks}

-   use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)s, if you want to
-   extensively use `.gitignore` for sensitive data and output

# Download files explicitly -- two options

::: columns
::: column
1.  Download files the following way:

```         

library(here)

download.file(
  url, 
  here("output/file.csv")
)
```
:::

::: column
2.  Describe how you downloaded files and where you saved them in your README:

```         

I downloaded data 
from [url] and saved it 
to [output/some_file.csv].
```

# Use `dotenv`

**Never** hardcode your credentials. If you need credentials to download things, use `dotenv`. With this, you create a file called `.env` in your root folder. The contents look like this:

```         
password="1234"
```

Then, when you need to use the password:

```         
library(dotenv)

some_function(password = Sys.getenv("password"))
```

# Use a `README`

In your root folder, you should have a file called `README.md`. In this, you describe what you are doing, and how to replicate it.

Please also describe how to replicate your analysis. One way of doing this is including a chunk like this:

```         

library(here)
here("R/load/01-load-first-data.R") |> source()
here("R/load/02-load-second-data.R") |> source()
...
```

# Make sure your code runs

I need to run your code in the end. Please make sure your code runs, for example by simply copying the files you're giving to me into a new Project and re-running them.

# Folder structure

A folder structure I would strongly recommend is the following. Please make sure to seperate loading, wrangling, analysing data, and then reporting the results.

-   input
-   output
-   R
    -   load
    -   wrangle
    -   analysis
-   report

# Don't save your workspace image {.allowframebreaks}

# Structure your code

-   load `library`s in the beginning
-   use a linter (mark everything with `Ctrl + A`, then lint with `Ctrl + Shift + A`)

# Report with quarto

-   using a `.qmd` file to report your findings is handy
-   you can export to `html`, but also as a `pdf` or `docx`
